# Davinsci


**davinsci** is a Python script that converts images into ASCII art. It resizes the image and generates a text-based representation using a set of predefined characters.

## How to Use

To use **davinsci**, you need to have Python installed along with the Pillow library. 

## Usage

The script requires three arguments: the path to the image file, the desired width, and the desired height. Make sure to pass the image path within quotes.

### example 
python davinsci.py "path\to\your\image.jpg" width height

python davinsci.py "D:\Programming\random\ascii_art\your_image.jpg" 375 250
